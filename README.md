# Aloha Homepage - Project 1

This is the first webpage I have created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a homepage for a "client", Aloha Apparel. The process for completing this project was to start with the desktop design and then refractor and implement a mobile-first responsive layout with FlexBox. JavaScript was also added for a carousel and for the client to subscribe for a newsletter using an email address.
